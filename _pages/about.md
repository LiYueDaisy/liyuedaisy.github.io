I am a first year PhD student from [Department of Sociology, Chinese University of Hong Kong.](https://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/) My research interests are in the areas of academic inequality, disciplinary development, and knowledge structures. My research project is about the disciplinary knowledge development of Chinese sociology and the academic careers of sociologists.
